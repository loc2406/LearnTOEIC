                "title": "STUDY BUSINESS IN SINGAPORE\nThe Singapore Business School (SBS) is located in the heart of Singapore’s financial district. We offer a range of high-quality courses aimed at preparing students for graduate school. Between classroom sessions you can explore the city and cultivate business connections. We offer content-based classes, such as finance, economics, and international marketing, as well as classes on preparing graduate school applications, including developing CVs and writing personal statements.\nWe have helped thousands of students gain entry into graduate programmes around the world. We boast a number of high-profile part-time instructors who are experts in their fields, including Diara Rhodes, chief financial officer of Auto Drive Korea, and Farah Wan, vice president of the Kuala Lumpur Union Lenders. For more information about our impressive faculty and course offerings, or to enroll online, visit our Web site at www.sbs.edu.sg.\nWhat Our Students Are Saying\n3 June by Atsushi Koshi\nI took a finance course at SBS. The school I am now attending in the United Kingdom had a prerequisite that I had not fulfilled while earning my Bachelor’s degree, so the eight-week course was convenient. However, I couldn’t afford the high rent in the area, so I had to commute, and the traffic in that area is terrible. I wish SBS offered a dormitory for students at the school. The quality of instruction was superb. My lecturer was Diara Rhodes. Though she tended to rush through lectures, discussing a wide range of topics in a small amount of time, I did learn a lot from the reading and from her descriptions of real-world experiences. The way she solved business problems was a source of inspiration during my graduate school interview, and it is also helping me in my current classes.\nEmail\nTo: atsushi.koshi@scholarmail.co.uk\nFrom: Isommersell@sbs.edu.sg\nSubject: Your review\nDate: 15 August\nDear Mr. Koshi,\nThank you for your feedback. You’re not the first person to voice this particular concern. Just so you know, we plan on addressing it by following your recommendation.
